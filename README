This program prints the file structure of all directories, python files within a target directory.
For every python file it prints out every class, method and stand alone or instance specific variable.
It also prints out doc strings for classes and methods.

The program works by calling it with
'python main.py' and then providing the system path that you want to analyze

Example:
'python main.py ~/projects'  --> Analyzes the file structure and python files in the folder projects.

An optional second argument is a name. If you provide the name only the subtree of the node with that name will be displayed

Example:
'python main.py ~/projects Node'  Inspects the subtree of nodes of the Node class if it is found within the target directory.


Optional parameters:
Entering any of these parameters in any combination disables the displaying of nodes with that node type. Any subtrees from nodes
that are not displayed will also not be displayed.
-F : File,
-C : Class,
-M : Method,
-V : Variable,
-D : DocString,

Example:
'python main.py ~/projects Node.py -M' Displays the subtree of the Node.py file, but does not display any methods, and thus also not any
variables within methods or docstrings attached to methods.
