This program prints the file structure of all directories, python files within a target directory.
For every python file it prints out every class, method and stand alone or instance specific variable.
It also prinst out doc strings for classes and methods.

The program works by calling it with
'python main.py' and then providing an absolute adress as the first parameter to the directory you would like to inspect all python files of.

Example:
'python main.py ~/projects/directory-with-python-files'
